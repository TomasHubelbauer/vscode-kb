## Binary files

No VS Code API handler will respond if you open a binary file in VS Code unless you manually click to open it as text.
This makes it impossible to implement things like display image/video/audio preview when selecting a media file or
display decompiled source code when opening a binary (maybe allowing to recompile upon save).
